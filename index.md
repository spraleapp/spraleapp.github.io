## Little bit about Reading..

Learning English is not always easy. When we moved to the world of digital and mobile, we tend to forget the old good habits - **Reading**. We all know that people around us, they are very good at English vocabulary. Not sure if you ever noticed, there is one thing common among them - reading habit, it can be books, blogs, news - But reading is important.

Most of the time we forget about the new word we learn from an article or news. Next time it is a bit confusing, aw…I know this word..but I can't remember anymore. right? how do I fix this problem?

We are in the era of busy life, most of us won't get enough time to read, but what if we can utilise our tiny free period for reading and improve vocabulary with the help of technology. That is where **[Sprale](apple.com)** comes. A small initiative to motivate reading and improve your vocabulary.

## What is Sprale

**Sprale** is an iOS app which helps us to explore 100’s of online reading sites and keep track of your mystery words you look-up every time in your reading sites. You will have your dictionary setup by in Sprale, where you can see all the words your already look-up. It will also tell you some more information about the words. This will help you to understand the list of your difficult words and Sprale engine will help you to remind these words, even if you forget.

Periodically, you will learn the word and you will never need to look-up the word again.
This is a small experimental initiative to help the people out there who need help from technology. It is free and we don't track who read what content or look-up words - we respect your privacy.

**_Start reading and build your vocabulary._**
