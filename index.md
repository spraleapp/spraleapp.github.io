# Little bit about Reading..

Learning english is not always easy. When we moved to the world of digital and mobile, we tend to forget the old good habits - **Reading**. We all know that people around us, they are very good at english vocabulary. We are not sure if you ever noticed, there should be one thing common among them reading habbit.

Most of the time we forget about the new word we learn every time we read an article or news. Next time it is bit confusing, aw..I know this word..but dont remember anymore. right ?

We are in era of busy life, most of us wont get enough time to read, but what if we can utilise our tiny free period for reading and improve vocabulary with the help of technology. That is where **[Sprale](apple.com)** comes. A small initiative to motivate reading and  improve your vacubulary.

# What is Sprale

Sprale is an iOS app help you to explore 100's of online reading sites and keep track of your mystery words you look-up in your reading sites. You will have your own dictionary in Sprale, where you can see all the words your previously look-up. It will also tell you some more information about the words. This will help you to understand the list of your difficult words and Sprale engine will help you to remind these words, even if you forget about these. 

Periodically, you will learn the word and you will never need to look-up the word again.
This is a small experimental initiative to help the people out there who need help from technology. It is absalutely free and we don't track who read what content or look-up words.
We respect your privacy.

> _Sprale originated from two German words - sprache and Lernen
Sprache means Language and Lernen means Learn_
