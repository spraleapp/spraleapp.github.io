## Little bit about Reading..

Learning English is not always easy. In this era of digitalization, we tend to forget the good old habits - Reading. As we all know most people are good at English vocabulary and one thing common among them is reading, it can be books, blogs, news.

We come across difficult words while we read an interesting book or some news. We may have to check the meaning of them and in some cases, it kills the mood. Often we forget about the new word we learn. Next time when we come across the same word, it is a bit confusing and we are like, aw…I know this word, but I can’t remember it. right? how do I fix this problem?

As we are busy with our life, what if we utilize some free time for reading and improve vocabulary with the help of technology. That is where **[Sprale](apple.com)** comes. A small initiative to motivate reading and improve your vocabulary.

## What is Sprale

**Sprale** is an iOS app that helps us to explore 100’s of online reading sites and keep track of your mystery words you look-up every time in your reading sites. You can have your dictionary setup in Sprale, where you can see all the words you have already found out. It will also give you more information about those words. This will help you to understand and keep the list of your difficult words and Sprale engine will help you to remind these words periodically, even if you forget.
Periodically, you will learn the word and will never have to look-up the word again. This is a small experimental initiative to help the people to make your reading easy. It is free and we respect your privacy.
